TODO:

write a base class for benchmarkinstance to inherit from that implements readout twirling

Write a PERExperiment class that centralizes data like the experiment class does
    pass in a list of circuits and represent them as PERinstances
    PERinstances inherit from the same class as benchmarkinstances
    pass is a noisemodel and readoutmodel

Classes to write
- instance
- PERExperiment
- PERCircuitExperiment - like the layerlearning is to the experiment class
- PERInstance
- readoutmodel
