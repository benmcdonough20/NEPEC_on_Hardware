    "# PEC representation of Rigetti gates using Mitiq\n",
    "This was originally intended to be a part of the `process_gst.ipynb` notebook, but it seems as though Mitiq and pyGSTi rely on competing versions of Numpy. My solution was to pickle the resulting operators and unpickle them in this notebook. Ideally I would like to get both running together.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran a pyGSTi gate set tomography of $X(-\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ and $Z(-\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ on the Rigetti hardware. PyGSTi spits out transfer matrices, which can be converted to superoperator representations using `forest.benchmarking.operator_tools.superoperator_transformations.pauli_liouville2superop`. These were then imported here. First, I generated a noisy basis of operators by taking arbitrary products of noisy operators in the set. Then, I used the `mitiq.pec.representations.optimal.find_optimal_representation` method to generate an optimal representation of the nosiy gate. I compared the complexity of the distribution and the overhead for different gate depths. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several improvements I would like to make going forward. pyGSTi uses pre-computed lists of feducials, which are required to be informationally complete and maximally orthogonal, and a set of germs to be repeated at different depths, which they term 'amplificationally complete'. Because I still don't understand how these are constructed, I am using the default modelpacks. The modelpack I chose did not include idling. In the future I would like to repeat this and see how much the inclusion of the idle gate affects the QPD representation. In addition, I would like to know how accurate this model is for different qubits. I would like to run gate set tomographies on different qubits to see how they compare, and test if the same QPD representations are approximately correct for all of the qubits. Lastly, there is something weird going on with the interpretation of $RX(\\theta)$ as $\\exp(i\\frac{\\theta}{2})$ or $\\exp(-i\\frac{\\theta}{2})$. I don't know whether this is coming from the mitiq, pyGSTi, pyQuil, or Qiskit representation. The results look correct but at one point I had to drop a sign without knowing why."

    "Other than the weird sign disagreement in the operator which I am still looking into, the results mostly behave as expected. One surprising behavior is that the protocol fails when the `NoisyBasis` has too many elements. Since each element can only increase the span, I expected that the fit would get better and better. I suspect that the protocol is ideal for an actual basis, that is an orthogonal spanning set, which is therefore also minimal. The trend in the sampling overhead was different for the different tolerance levels. At a low tolerance, the overhead actually grew with the addition of more elements, with no benefit to the precision. However at very low tolerances, the overhead improved significantly with increased number of basis elements. \n",

If so, then they could be imported to generate these lists. I think these results point generally to a choice of a basis with more redundancy over less, but the process should also be guided in some way to optimize the overhead and complexity with respect to the tolerance and basis depth."
